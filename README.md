1)Fuctional Requirement Improvement:

In the Search Terms box, allow the user to search by course ID, so searching ECE444, will bring up Software Engineering course page instead of having to type in software, and scroll through the list to find the course.

2)Non-Functional Requirement Improvement:

Usability needs to be improved, hard to read and extract data, could be done by improving the overall UI and adding better diagrams and tables.
